## What is TypeORM?

TypeORM is an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) (ORM) for node.js that can be used with TypeScript or JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide features that help you to develop any kind of applications that use a database - from small applications with a few tables, to large scale enterprise applications.

**TypeORM helps you to:**

*   automatically create the database table schemes based on your models
*   transparently insert / update / delete to the database your objects
*   map your selections from tables to javascript objects and map table columns to object properties
*   easily create one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relations between tables
*   and much more...

**TypeORM** uses the [data mapper pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern), unlike all other javascript ORMs that currently exist, which means you can write loosely coupled, scalable, maintainable applications. The benefit of using an ORM is ability to focus on the business logic (your application) and less on the persistence layer (your database).

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/) and [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).
